# 🔍 Selenium Web Scraper for Partineh & Asamkala

This Python script uses Selenium to search for a list of product model numbers on two Iranian e-commerce websites: [Partineh](https://partineh.com) and [Asamkala](https://asamkala.com). It attempts to find each product and extract its price if available, saving the results in a `result.txt` file.
